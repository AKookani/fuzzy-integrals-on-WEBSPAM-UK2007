# fuzzy-integrals-on-WEBSPAM-UK2007
Welcome to the WEBSPAM-UK2007 Dataset Spam Classification project! ðŸ“§ðŸš«

This Python project leverages the power of fuzzy integrals, specifically Sugeno and Choquet integrals, to tackle the challenging task of classifying spam and non-spam emails within the WEBSPAM-UK2007 dataset.

Hint: the refined data file is included under WEB.txt
