# fuzzy-integrals-on-WEBSPAM-UK2007
Welcome to the WEBSPAM-UK2007 Dataset Spam Classification project! ðŸ“§ðŸš«

This Python project leverages the power of fuzzy integrals, specifically Sugeno and Choquet integrals, to tackle the challenging task of classifying spam and non-spam emails within the WEBSPAM-UK2007 dataset. With an increasing volume of email spam, accurate spam detection is crucial for maintaining the integrity of email communication. This project provides a robust solution using advanced mathematical techniques.
